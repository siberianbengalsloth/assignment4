            <p>The art of Krav Maga was founded byÂ Imi Lichtenfeld (Sde-Or). Imi was born in Bratislava to a renowned
               police officer and circus acrobat. As a child, Imi excelled in various sports such as wrestling and
               boxing and practiced several martial arts. When anti-semite riots began to spread through his home town
               Imi and his family were forced to immigrate to Israel (Palestine at the time).</p><br>
            In 1948, Once Israel had declared it's independence, IDF's (Israeli Defense Force) officials approached Imi
            and requested him to develop a system of self defense and fighting based upon his experience and his work
            with special forces units as the 'Hagana', 'Palmach' and 'Palyam'<br>
            <br>
            During his 20 years of service as chief instructor of hand-to-hand combat, Imi carefully refined the methods
            of Krav Maga, Making it the official combative training for all military personnel, Israeli police and
            security forces. Imi developed a doctrine enabling both fit and out-of-shape soldiers to practice it
            successfully. Rather than rigid movements and techniques requiring years of training Krav Maga integrated
            instinctive and simple moves accessible to all. <br>

         <h3>Birth of International Krav Maga Federation</h3>
         <p>In 1964 Imi retired from the IDF and continued teaching Krav Maga to civilians, as well as law enforcement
            units and military applications. The Krav Maga association was founded by Imi and several of his students in
            1978, aiming to promote KM's unique techniques locally and throughout the world. <br>
            <br>
            When the teaching of Krav Maga (KM) started to spread beyond the borders of Israel, arose a need to found an
            international organization. This happened mostly because the initial KM association existing at the time was
            divided and not functioning efficiently, due to dissension amongst the higher graded instructors. Imi
            resulted in forming a new international KM federation with the support of his most loyal students and
            respected instructors, among which IKMF's chairman nowadays, Avi Moyal.

         Once the IKMF was finally formed, All Expert and Master Diplomas, grades and levels issued by it, were
         authorized by Imi, As well as the IKMF curriculum. Imi approved this new curriculum at the time of formation
         of the IKMF as well as subsequent changes made in 1997.
         <br><br>
         Since 1996 The IKMF expanded and is now the largest and most appreciated KM institution worldwide. The IKMF
         has branched out and is successfully active locally, in Israel as well as in Australia, North America, South
         & East Asia, the Far East, Most EU countries, and ex-communist countries (such as Poland, Russia and
         Hungary). The general Structure of the organization in each country is relatively similar: A director,
         responsible for the growth of both the KM system and the local IKMF organization in said country, and, of
         course, local instructors at different grades and levels assisting him.

            <a name="director"></a>
            <h3>Director of Korea: <b>Yeseul Park</b></h3>
            <p>Yeseul started learning martial arts at an early age. Born and raised in Korea until 17, she started
               learning and practicing <b><em>Kyokushin Karate</em></b> when she was 13.
               <b><em>Kyokushin</em></b> is very demanding physically and she learned discipline through it. By the time
               she immigrated to the United States, she was able to protect herself against bare-hand attacks. However,
               she quickly learned that in the US, she needed to know more than just bare-hand fighting. There were so
               many weapons.
               Yeseul started looking for something that will teach how to defend herself against different types of
               weapons, mainly knives and different types of guns. She found Krav Maga and fell in love with it, and
               started training in 2018. <br>
               After training for a few years, her director recommended her to become an instructor herself. Upon
               acceptance, her journey to become and instructor started!
               <br>

            <figcaption>Yeseul (left) sparring with an opponent (right).</figcaption>
            <br>
            She started her first Civilian Instructor's Course(CIC 1) in Maryland, USA. The first part was arduous 10
            days. Upon completion of the course and passing the final test, she was eligible to move onto the second
            part.
            After passing the first CIC, she was deployed to South Korea for her work and then the Covid-19 broke out,
            so she couldn't return to participate in the second CIC immediately. So she kept training for another 2
            years and finally went to Brunei Darussalam to continue with part 2.

            Upon completion, she passed the second part of CIC with highest scores and became an instructor. Two months
            after becoming an instructor, she started teaching classes!

            <br>
            Yeseul likes working with different types of guns (though she does not personally own any) and plans on
            becoming a tactical shooting instructor in the future as well.

            <br>
            She looks forward to expanding her student-base and is excited to take on the role of Korean Director. The
            journey is only beginning!
